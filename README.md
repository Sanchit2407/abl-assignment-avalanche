ABL-Assignment
====================

Description
--------------------
For this assignment, you will be authoring rudimentary, intermediate, and advanced ABL behaviors for a single agent that controls multiple bots.

Starter Tasks
--------------------
* Add a move action that takes a (int xdir, int ydir, int id) as input.
* Make a MoveTo behavior that moves a bot to a target location over time.
* Add a SetColor action that takes (int r, int b, int g).
* Add color sensing to the BotWME.

Intermediate Tasks
--------------------
* Add on action that creates a new Bot
* Create 4 bots and have them keep a formation around the player.

Advanced Tasks
--------------------
Design and create a multi-bot social interaction that communicates to the player via movement and bot color. The player should be able to interact with your multi-bot behavior set through movement, shooting, or some other user interaction that you design.

Here are some spaces you can design multi-bot social interactions for but feel free to create your own:
* loneliness - how would the bots make the player feel lonely?
* factions - split the bots into two factions and put the player in the middle.
* stigma - if the character or a bot had a stigma (i.e. an extremely undesirable social quality), how would the bots react? If a bot or player interacted with the stigmatized character, how should the others react?
* building trust - The player starts as not being trusted by the bots. How would they gain their trust and how would the bots performance change?
